# HacklabGarage 2025 Project

A Raspberry Pi turns a vintage telephone into a playful oracle.  
A nearby **PIR sensor (GPIO 17)** triggers a pseudo-random ring via Fritz!Box;  
when the handset is lifted (**hook switch GPIO 23**), a short, guided dialog runs.  
Spotlights (**GPIO 27**) switch on during ringing/interaction, and off afterwards.

The oracle flow:

1. **Greeting** – “Hello.”
2. **Ask Name** – Fake-interactive (wait) or optional STT (~7s).  
3. **Ask Birth Month** – Fake-interactive (wait) or optional STT (~10s).  
4. **Story Telling** – playful templates, e.g.:  
   *“For Alex, born in July: in Chemnitz, check out …”*  
   Lost gadgets of the Garage, or POIs from the city map.  
5. **Good Advice** – *“It brings you luck to go to …”*  
6. **Cooldown** – prevent repeated ringing (e.g., 90s).

The system works fully offline (no LLM required).  
Optional offline speech-to-text (STT, Vosk) lets you actually parse  
the spoken **name** and **birth month**.

## How It Works (Flow)
# Workflow – Telephone in the Garage (with GPIOs)

## GPIO Mapping
- **PIR Sensor (Input):** GPIO 17  
  → triggers the workflow when motion is detected.  
- **Hook Switch (Input):** GPIO 23  
  → goes LOW when handset is lifted.  
- **Spotlight / Relay (Output):** GPIO 27  
  → switched ON when phone rings and during interaction, OFF when finished.  

---

## 1. Idle → Sensor Trigger
- System waits for a trigger from the **PIR sensor (GPIO 17)**.  
- When motion is detected → workflow starts.

## 2. Random Delay (3–15 s)
- Sleep for a random period between 3 and 15 seconds.  
- Builds suspense.

## 3. Ring via Fritz!Box
- Raspberry Pi places a SIP call to the Fritz!Box (e.g., `**1`).  
- **Spotlight ON (GPIO 27 HIGH).**  
- Fritz!Box drives the real mechanical bells.  
- Ring loops until handset is lifted, or timeout reached.

## 4. Handset Pickup Detection
- **Hook switch (GPIO 23)** goes LOW when handset lifted.  
- Immediately hang up the Fritz!Box call → bells stop.  
- Proceed to interaction.  
- If no pickup: cancel, cooldown, **Spotlight OFF (GPIO 27 LOW)**, return to idle.  
- **General rule:** if call ends *unnaturally* (user hangs up mid-dialogue) → cancel, cooldown, **Spotlight OFF**, return to idle.

## 5. Greeting
- Play greeting (TTS or pre-recorded MP3):  
  *“Hello.”*

## 6. Ask Name
- Prompt: *“What’s your name?”*  
- **Fake-Interactive mode:** wait ~7 s, then continue.  
- **STT-only mode:** record ~7 s; extract name heuristically  
  (e.g., *“I’m Alex”*, *“My name is …”*).  
- If nothing recognized → fallback: **Friend**.  
- If handset hung up → cancel, cooldown, **Spotlight OFF**, return to idle.

## 7. Ask Birth Month
- Prompt: *“Which month were you born?”*  
- **Fake-Interactive mode:** wait ~10 s, then continue.  
- **STT-only mode:** record ~10 s; map recognized token  
  to one of 12 months (or a number 1–12 → month).

## 8. Story Telling
- Generate a random oracle-like story from templates, e.g.:  
  - *“Okay Alex, I would like to tell you about the lost gadgets in the Garage:  
    radio, mixer, desk/table, typewriter … for people born in {Month}.”*  
  - *“I recommend you go to {POI from the Chemnitz city map}.”*  
- Add good advice: *“It brings you luck to go to …”*  
- Speak via **pico2wave TTS** or play pre-recorded MP3s.

## 9. Cooldown
- Start cooldown (e.g., 90 s) to avoid repeated ringing.  
- Wait until handset is replaced.  
- **Spotlight OFF (GPIO 27 LOW).**  
- Return to idle.

### State Machine Summary
IDLE (GPIO 17 waiting) → TRIGGERED → DELAY →
RING(Fritz!Box + GPIO 27 ON) → [GPIO 23 LOW?] →
GREETING → ASK_NAME → GET_NAME →
ASK_MONTH → GET_MONTH → STORY_TELLING →
COOLDOWN(GPIO 27 OFF) → IDLE

## Hardware Setup

### Components
- Vintage telephone (with handset speaker & hook switch).
- Raspberry Pi (Pi 4 recommended).
- PIR sensor (or other trigger: ultrasonic, reed switch).
- Hook switch button (detects when handset is lifted).
- Audio wiring: 3.5 mm jack → 2.8 mm flat connectors (to handset speaker).
- Optional: small buzzer for external ringing sound.

### Wiring
- **PIR sensor** → GPIO18 (signal), 5V, GND.  
- **Hook switch** → GPIO23 (to GND when handset lifted).  
- **Handset speaker** → Raspberry Pi audio out:  
- Ground → black/yellow wire.  
- One channel (red/white) → other handset wire.  
- **Audio test:**  
aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

### Software & Dependencies
Install on Raspberry Pi OS:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-pyaudio sox libttspico-utils ffmpeg
pip3 install pygame vosk

##Configuration (English Defaults)

Audio prompts: record or generate via TTS in English.

TTS language: use pico2wave -l en-GB (or en-US) in the say() helper.

STT model path: ~/models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15

Months list (English): ["january", "february", "march", "april", "may", "june",
 "july", "august", "september", "october", "november", "december"]


Cities/locations: seed with your local flavor (e.g., Chemnitz, Ahorngarage, …).
